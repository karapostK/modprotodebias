## Installation

### Environment

- Install the environment with
  `conda env create -f modprotodebias.yml`
- Activate the environment with `conda activate modprotodebias`


### Data

- move into the folder with `cd data/<dataset_folder>`
- run `python <dataset_name>_processor.py`

If you have problems with the LFM2b data, ping me and I'll be happy to help

### Pre-Trained Models

- download the pre-trained ProtoMF models from [here](https://drive.jku.at/filr/public-link/file-download/0cce88f0905932a10190c68ce5731feb/62214/-7633188943201829349/pre_trained_models.zip)
- place the two folders inside `pre_trained_models` folder (default)
- (optional) adjust the path files in the `conf.yml` if you have issues

## Usage

Adjust the configuration of your experiment in `run_full_debiasing.py`.

The experiments can be started with

`python start.py run_full_debiasing`

or define sweep configurations to use with the wandb sweep command

`wandb sweep sweep_config.yaml`
